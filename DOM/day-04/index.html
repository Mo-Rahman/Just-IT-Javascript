  <!-- Now it's your turn to experiment.

  1 - Can you bind an event?  You have to pass the (e) to bind the event to the click - the event being an eventListener like a click. 
        

  2 - What happens if you want more than one line of code in the function?  
  
  My assumption was that it would only action one line of code, having tested it - It seems to apply the change to innerHTML and the style.color -->
